Start with a tree file, use ete3 to create a cophenetic distance matrix

if we have a tree like

                           ----A
              _____________|y
              |            |
              |            ----B
      ________|z
              |            ----C
              |            |
              |____________|x     -----D
                           |      |
                           |______|w
                                  |
                                  |
                                  -----E

Where w,x,y,z are internal nodes.
d(A,B) = d(y,A) + d(y,B)
and
d(A, E) = d(z,A) + d(z, E) = {d(z,y) + d(y,A)} + {d(z,x) + d(x,w) + d(w,E)}

We use an idea inspired by the ete3 team: https://gist.github.com/jhcepas/279f9009f46bf675e3a890c19191158b :

For each node find its path to the root.

e.g.

A -> A, y, z
E -> E, w, x,z

and make these orderless sets. Then we XOR the two sets to only find the elements
that are in one or other sets but not both. In this case A, E, y, x, w.

The distance between the two nodes is the sum of the distances from each of those nodes
to the parent

One more optimization: since the distances are symmetric, and distance to itself is zero
we user itertools.combinations rather than itertools.permutations. This cuts our computes from theta(n^2)
1/2n^2 - n (= O(n^2), which is still not great, but in reality speeds things up for large trees).
